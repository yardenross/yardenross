            <p>
              Willie is a lively 2-year-old King Charles Cavalier with a huge personality packed into his small frame.
              This playful pup loves nothing more than chasing after balls and his favorite toys,
              bringing endless energy to games of fetch. Willie’s adventurous spirit makes him the perfect companion for hikes and trips,
              though he has a distinct dislike for the beach—sand and waves just aren’t his thing!
              Friendly to everyone he meets, Willie seems blissfully unaware of his petite size,
              often barking confidently at large dogs without hesitation.
              His endearing charm and boundless enthusiasm make him a joy to be around for both people and pets alike.

            <blockquote>
              <p>
                John, our 4-year-old furry addition, joined the family just last year and quickly
                made himself at home. Calm and sweet-natured, he loves to play—especially when Willie’s
                willing to share his toys! While he’s a gentle soul, John has an adventurous side and gets
                excited every time he sees his leash, ready for a stroll around the neighborhood or a
                hike through the park. His loyalty is unmatched; he’ll follow you wherever you go,
                even to the bathroom, always wanting to be close. He’s a fan of walks, enjoys a good bark to
                announce visitors, and has a particular fondness for giving endless licks,
                showing his affection in the most enthusiastic way. Whether he’s curled up by your
                feet or trotting along at your side, his unwavering devotion and gentle spirit bring warmth
                to every moment. The phrase “loyal as a dog” must have been written with him in mind,
                as his love for his family is truly heartwarming and constant.

      <h2>About The Breed</h2>
      <div class="container">
        <article id="text__blockquotes">
          <div>
            <blockquote>
              <p>
                The Cavalier King Charles Spaniel, often called the Cavalier,
                is a small, affectionate breed known for its friendly and gentle nature.
                Originally popular among British royalty, Cavaliers are beloved for their charming looks,
                with expressive eyes, silky coats, and feathery tails. They come in four colors: Blenheim, Tricolor,
                Black and Tan, and Ruby.

                Cavaliers are incredibly social, great with kids and other pets,
                and happiest when with their families. They’re adaptable, enjoying both cozy
                indoor time and outdoor adventures like walks or playtime. While typically calm, they still have a bit of a
                hunting instinct and might chase small animals.
                
                Known for their loyalty and devotion, Cavaliers are wonderful companion dogs.
                They may be prone to some health issues, so regular care is important. With love and attention, Cavaliers
                bring endless warmth and joy to any household.
